# Backend AI Agent Instructions for Climate Connect

> **Mission**: Build robust Django APIs and services that power the climate action platform.

## Backend Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Django 4.2 + Django REST Framework
- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension (geospatial data)
- **Caching/Message Broker**: Redis
- **Real-time**: Django Channels (WebSocket support via ASGI)
- **Background Tasks**: Celery + Celery Beat (scheduled tasks)
- **Authentication**: Django REST Knox (token-based)
- **Package Manager**: PDM (pyproject.toml)
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage (media files)
- **Testing**: Django test framework + Factory Boy + Faker

## Architecture Patterns

### Django App Structure
Each domain has its own app (climateconnect_api, organization, chat_messages, hubs, ideas, climate_match, location, translations):

```
app_name/
  ├── models/          # Database models (can be split into multiple files)
  ├── serializers/     # DRF serializers for API responses
  ├── views/           # API views/viewsets
  ├── permissions.py   # Custom DRF permissions
  ├── urls.py          # URL routing
  ├── admin.py         # Django admin customization
  ├── utility/         # Helper functions
  ├── migrations/      # Database migrations
  ├── locale/          # Translation files (i18n)
  └── tests/           # Test files
```

### API Design
- **RESTful API**: Standard REST endpoints with DRF ViewSets and APIViews
- **WebSocket**: Real-time chat via Django Channels consumers
- **Background Processing**: Celery tasks for async operations (email, notifications, etc.)

## Code Style & Best Practices

### Formatting & Linting
- **Formatting**: Use `black` for code formatting (configured in pyproject.toml)
- **Linting**: Follow PEP 8
- **Commands**:
  - Run `make format` (or `black .`) before committing
  - Use `make start` to start the development server
  - Use `python manage.py <command>` for Django management commands
  - **Important**: Always activate the PDM virtual environment first with `pdm venv activate django4` before running any Python commands

### Models
- Use explicit `related_name` for relationships
- Add helpful `__str__` methods
- Use `choices` for enum-like fields
- Include docstrings for complex models
- Add appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields
- Use `select_related`/`prefetch_related` for query optimization

### Serializers
- Keep serializers focused and single-purpose
- Use nested serializers for related data
- Implement `create()` and `update()` for complex operations
- Validate input data properly

### Views/ViewSets
- Use ViewSets for standard CRUD operations
- Use APIView for custom endpoints
- Apply appropriate permission classes
- Return proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, etc.)
- Implement proper pagination for list endpoints

### Permissions
- Create custom permission classes in `permissions.py`
- Follow least privilege principle
- Implement proper authentication checks

### Async Support
- Use async views/consumers for real-time features (Django Channels)
- Handle WebSocket connections with token authentication

## Common Commands

### Development
- `make start` - Start Django development server
- `make format` - Format code with black
- `python manage.py makemigrations` - Create migrations
- `python manage.py migrate` - Apply migrations
- `python manage.py createsuperuser` - Create admin user
- Run tests by activating the PDM virtual environment first: `pdm venv activate django4`, then run `python manage.py test`

### Running Tests

Always use `pdm run` to run tests (avoids needing to activate the venv manually):

```bash
# Run all tests in a module
cd backend && pdm run python manage.py test organization.tests.test_event_registration --keepdb

# Run a specific test class
cd backend && pdm run python manage.py test organization.tests.test_event_registration.TestAdminNotificationTask --keepdb

# Run a single test method
cd backend && pdm run python manage.py test organization.tests.test_event_registration.TestAdminNotificationTask.test_task_exits_early_when_notify_admins_toggled_off --keepdb
```

**`--keepdb`**: Reuse the existing test database instead of recreating it. Required when the test DB already exists (avoids the interactive "delete?" prompt that breaks non-interactive terminals).

If the test DB does not yet exist, omit `--keepdb` for the first run.

#### Avoiding file corruption when editing files open in PyCharm

PyCharm has autosave enabled. When the agent writes to a file that PyCharm has open, a race condition can occur:

1. Agent writes change A via `apply_diff` → file on disk updated.
2. PyCharm detects external modification and reloads — but may have buffered an in-memory version of the file.
3. Agent writes change B via a second `apply_diff` → PyCharm's buffered version (which may not include change A) gets saved, overwriting change B or producing duplicated/corrupted content.

**Rules to avoid this:**

- **Batch edits to the same file**: use a single `apply_diff` call with multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks rather than separate calls in sequence.
- **For bulk text replacements on large files**: use a CLI Python one-liner (`python3 -c "content = open(...).read(); content = content.replace(...); open(..., 'w').write(content)"`) which is atomic from PyCharm's perspective.
- **Never mix `apply_diff` and CLI edits on the same file** in the same session — pick one approach and stick to it.
- **After a CLI edit, re-read the file** before making further `apply_diff` calls to ensure the baseline is current.

#### Infrastructure dependencies for tests

Django tests require **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** to be running. If tests fail with connection errors, stop and ask the user to start the required services before continuing:

| Error symptom | Likely cause | Ask user to |
|---|---|---|
| `connection refused` on port 5432 | PostgreSQL not running | Start PostgreSQL (e.g. `brew services start postgresql` or start the dev container) |
| `connection refused` on port 6379 | Redis not running | Start Redis (e.g. `brew services start redis` or start the dev container) |
| `CHANNEL_LAYERS` / `channels_redis` errors | Redis not running | Start Redis |

**Do not attempt to work around infrastructure failures by modifying test code or settings.** Stop, explain the problem to the user, and ask them to start the missing service.

### Background Tasks
- `celery -A climateconnect_main worker -l info` - Start Celery worker
- `celery -A climateconnect_main beat -l info` - Start Celery beat (scheduler)

### Database
- `psql` - PostgreSQL REPL (in dev container or `psql -h localhost -U <user> <db>`)
- `redis-cli -h redis` - Redis REPL (in dev container) or `redis-cli`

## Important Considerations

### Performance
- Always consider database performance (use `select_related`/`prefetch_related` for relations)
- Implement proper pagination for list endpoints
- Add appropriate indexes in models for frequently queried fields
- Use transactions for multi-model operations
- Cache expensive queries with Redis
- Handle timezone-aware datetimes (use Django's timezone utils)

### Security
- Validate all user input
- Use Django's built-in CSRF protection
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Follow least privilege for permissions
- Sanitize user-generated content (XSS prevention)
- Log errors appropriately

### Testing
- Write tests for new features using Django test framework + Factory Boy
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Clean up test data with `setUp()` and `tearDown()`
- Use `self.client` for API endpoint testing

#### Testing `transaction.on_commit` callbacks

Django's `TestCase` wraps each test in a transaction that never commits, so `transaction.on_commit` callbacks **do not fire** automatically. Two approaches:

**Option A — `captureOnCommitCallbacks` (Django 4.1+, preferred)**
```python
with mock_patch("myapp.views._my_task") as mock_task:
    with self.captureOnCommitCallbacks(execute=True):
        response = self.client.post(url)
mock_task.delay.assert_called_once_with(...)
```

**Option B — mock `transaction.on_commit` directly**
```python
with mock_patch("myapp.views._my_task") as mock_task, \
     mock_patch("myapp.views.transaction.on_commit", side_effect=lambda fn: fn()):
    response = self.client.post(url)
mock_task.delay.assert_called_once_with(...)
```

Both approaches make the `on_commit` callback execute synchronously within the test so you can assert on the task dispatch.

#### Mocking locally-imported functions in Celery tasks

Celery tasks often import helpers locally (inside the function body) to avoid circular imports:
```python
@app.task
def my_task(project_id):
    from myapp.utility.email import send_notification  # local import
    send_notification(...)
```

To mock `send_notification` in tests, patch it **at the module where it is defined**, not where it is imported:
```python
with mock_patch("myapp.utility.email.send_notification") as mock_send:
    my_task.apply(kwargs={"project_id": 1})
mock_send.assert_called_once()
```

#### Running Celery tasks synchronously in tests

Use `.apply()` (not `.delay()`) to run a task synchronously in tests:
```python
from myapp.tasks import my_task
my_task.apply(kwargs={"project_id": 1})
```

To test that a task raises `Retry` on failure, pass `throw=True`:
```python
from celery.exceptions import Retry
with self.assertRaises(Retry):
    my_task.apply(kwargs={"project_id": 1}, throw=True)
```

#### Key model related names

`ProjectMember` uses non-default related names — use these in ORM queries:
- `ProjectMember.user` → `related_name="project_member_user"` (User → ProjectMember)
- `ProjectMember.project` → `related_name="project_member_project"` (Project → ProjectMember)
- `ProjectMember.role` → `related_name="project_member_role"` (Role → ProjectMember)

Example — fetch all users who are admins on a project:
```python
admin_users = User.objects.filter(
    project_member_user__project=project,
    project_member_user__role__role_type__in=[Role.ALL_TYPE, Role.READ_WRITE_TYPE],
)
```

### Documentation Maintenance
Documentation updates are **part of every task**, not an afterthought. The specific files to update are listed in each checklist in the [Definition of Done](#definition-of-done) and [Quick Reference](#quick-reference-for-common-tasks) sections above.

Quick reference for which doc maps to which change:
| Change type | Doc to update |
|---|---|
| New or modified model / relationship | `doc/domain-entities.md` |
| New or modified API endpoint | `doc/api-documentation.md` |
| Significant architecture change | `doc/architecture.md` |
| New environment variable | `doc/environment-variables.md` |
| Major new feature | `doc/spec/` (optional, for reference) |

- **Note**: `/doc/spec/` contains optional specifications for reference — use as helpful context but not required. **Workflow**: GitHub Issues lead the work, specs provide fine-grained details when available.

## Common Code Patterns

### Model Example
```python
from django.db import models

class Example(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, db_index=True)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name="examples", on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ["-created_at"]
        indexes = [models.Index(fields=["name", "created_at"])]
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

### Serializer Example
```python
from rest_framework import serializers

class ExampleSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    user_name = serializers.CharField(source="user.username", read_only=True)
    
    class Meta:
        model = Example
        fields = ["id", "name", "created_at", "user", "user_name"]
        read_only_fields = ["id", "created_at"]
```

### ViewSet Example
```python
from rest_framework import viewsets
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated

class ExampleViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = ExampleSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
    
    def get_queryset(self):
        return Example.objects.select_related("user").filter(user=self.request.user)
```

### Validation Pattern

Django + DRF handle validation across three layers. Always rely on this pipeline and **do not duplicate validation manually** unless adding business logic.

#### Layer 1 — DRF Serializer (primary, runs automatically)
`ModelSerializer` maps model field constraints to serializer fields automatically:
- Type coercion (e.g. `"42"` → `int`, `"2026-03-19"` → `date`)
- `required`, `max_length`, `min_length`, `blank`, `null`, `choices`
- `unique=True` → `UniqueValidator` added automatically
- `unique_together` → `UniqueTogetherValidator` added automatically

Add custom logic using:
```python
# Single-field validation
def validate_name(self, value):
    if value.lower() == "banned":
        raise serializers.ValidationError("This name is not allowed.")
    return value

# Cross-field validation
def validate(self, attrs):
    if attrs["end_date"] < attrs["start_date"]:
        raise serializers.ValidationError("end_date must be after start_date.")
    return attrs
```

#### Layer 2 — Model `clean()` (NOT called automatically by DRF)
DRF **does not** call `model.full_clean()` before saving. If business rules live in `clean()`, call it explicitly in the serializer:
```python
def validate(self, attrs):
    instance = self.Meta.model(**attrs)
    try:
        instance.full_clean(exclude=["id"])
    except ValidationError as e:
        raise serializers.ValidationError(e.message_dict)
    return attrs
```
Prefer putting validation in the serializer rather than `clean()` to keep the API contract clear.

#### Layer 3 — Database constraints (last resort)
PostgreSQL enforces NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and FK integrity — but violations raise `IntegrityError`, which is **not** automatically converted to a 400 response. Rely on layers 1–2 to catch errors before hitting the DB.

#### Summary Table
| Constraint | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| Field type, max_length, required, blank, null | DRF serializer (auto from ModelSerializer) |
| choices | DRF serializer (auto) |
| unique, unique_together | DRF serializer (auto) |
| Cross-field business rules | `validate()` in serializer |
| Model `clean()` logic | Must call `full_clean()` explicitly |
| DB-level integrity | PostgreSQL (catch with try/except if needed) |

### Celery Task Example
```python
from climateconnect_main.celery import app

@app.task
def send_notification_email(user_id, message):
    # Task implementation
    pass
```

## Definition of Done

A task is **not complete** until all of the following are done:

- [ ] Code is formatted (`make format`)
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] **Documentation updated** (see each checklist below for which files)

> Documentation debt is real debt. If a model, endpoint, or architecture decision changed and the docs were not updated, the task is not done.

## Quick Reference for Common Tasks

### Adding a New Model
1. Create model in `app/models/`
2. Add to `app/models/__init__.py`
3. Create serializer in `app/serializers/`
4. Run `python manage.py makemigrations`
5. Run `python manage.py migrate`
6. Register in `app/admin.py` (optional)
7. Add tests in `app/tests/`
8. **Update `doc/domain-entities.md`** — add the new entity, its fields, and relationships

### Adding a New API Endpoint
1. Create view in `app/views/`
2. Add URL pattern in `app/urls.py`
3. Implement permissions in view or `app/permissions.py`
4. Create/update serializer
5. Test endpoint
6. **Update `doc/api-documentation.md`** — document the new endpoint, request/response format, and auth requirements

### Modifying an Existing Model or Relationship
1. Update model fields or relationships
2. Run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`
3. Update affected serializers and views
4. **Update `doc/domain-entities.md`** — reflect the changed fields or relationships
5. If the change affects API responses, **update `doc/api-documentation.md`** too

### Adding a Background Task
1. Create task in `app/tasks.py` with `@app.task` decorator (using Celery app)
2. Import and call with `.apply_async()` or `.delay()`
