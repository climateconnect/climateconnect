"""Remove the ClimateMatch feature.

This migration is ONE-WAY. The reverse operations are no-ops so that
`migrate organization 0144` does not fail, but the dropped tables and their
data do NOT come back. The archive produced before deploy (anonymised
aggregate CSV + full `dumpdata` JSON) is the only recovery path.
