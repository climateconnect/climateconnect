      fast fashion, a business model that offers trendy novelties with a high frequency, usually
      at very low costs. This mechanism impels customers to buy more, wear the product maybe a
      couple of times and then get rid of it, resulting in large amounts of textile waste, most
      of which is incinerated, landfilled or exported to developing countries. As a result,
      fashion brands are now producing almost twice the amount of clothing today compared with

          The latest reports estimate the fashion sector to be responsible for
          <b> 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions</b>. The data vary according to the source of
          energy used (as coal-based energy accounts for a larger footprint if compared to others).
          The most carbon-heavy production step is the fiber production, regardless of natural or
          synthetic. Cotton fibers, are to be preferred as their plants absorb carbon. Here you can
          choose between conventional and organic cultivation. Conventional cultivation has higher
          CO2-emissions than organic cultivation but the latter requires more water. Transportation,
          moreover, plays an important role as the different production steps occur in different
          countries. When shipping by container boat, transport only accounts for 1% of
          CO2-emissions of a piece of clothing. But when shipping through air cargo to save time,
          transportation in comparison accounts for the 35% in Co2 emissions. Ultimately, the
          emissions during the “use” phase of the clothes (washing, drying and ironing), merge into
          the natural resources consumption.

      pollution. The cultivation of cotton (entailing also land use issues in developing
      countries) represents another important factor, as it contributes to the drain of water
      resources that could be used to improve the lives of locals. As a matter of fact, the
      environmental damages are most visible in the countries where the production takes place,
      as the lack of regulations allow companies to overlook social responsibility. In Cambodia,
      for example, the fashion industry, which is responsible for 88% of all industrial
      manufacturing (as of 2008), has caused an estimated 60% of water pollution and 34% of

          In the life cycle of clothes, waste production starts at the very beginning. Up to 15% of
          fibers and fabrics are wasted in the manufacturing process. This happens due to wrong
          calculations and communications mistakes that often take place because of the distance
          between the design and production facilities. The stock arriving in the shops often
          remains unsold, or is returned becoming mostly a “waste”. This is a fundamental problem
          that every company is facing: Swedish fast-fashion brand{" "}
          <b>H&M was reported to hold $4.3 billion worth of unsold products</b> in warehouses,
          following reports of the company incinerating them at a waste-to-energy plant in Denmark.
          Online shopping returns, in particular clothes, have a massive return rate, between 40-50%
          as people order different products just to try the best fitting as they would do in a
          shop, thinking that the product will go back directly on the shelf again but in reality
          the majority can’t be resold as new. According to Optoro, a company that helps manage the
          returns, Americans send back each year 3.5 billion products, of which 5 billion pounds of
          them go to the landfill, causing 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the
          atmosphere.
