The Studentenwerk decided to take the issue into their own hands and is now in negotiations with a private company that does CO2-calculations for meals. They are willing to invest a significant sum of money into this project. We will be able to accompany the process and meet them every few months to control the process. The deal is not yet done but if it happens the result will be much more professional and it will be easier to copy the concept into other cities since we already know who to contact to do the CO2-calculations and how much it would cost.",
