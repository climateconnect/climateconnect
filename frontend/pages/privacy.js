      data to fulfill other legal obligations or based on your explicit consent.
      <h3> 5.1 For the performance of a contract</h3>
      We process our personal data in order to provide the services of our website, in particular

      (1), first sentence f) GDPR, except where your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms,

      following categories of recipients for the purposes set out above:

        <li>
          <b>Third parties at your request</b>: you may choose to share your activities with your

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Service providers and advisors</b>: third party service providers that perform services
          for us, on our behalf, which may include payments processing, providing analytic services
          (e.g. Google analytics; privacy policy is available
          <a
            href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            here
          </a>
          ) providing automatic email notification (e.g. Mailjet; Mailjet privacy policy is
          available
          <a href="https://www.mailjet.com/security-privacy/">here</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Transfer to processors</b>
          We use external service providers for the operation of the website and sending E-Mail as
          well as for the handling of donation payments. We use external server providers such as
          Mailjet for email communications and for the handling of payments within the context of
          the donations such as Paypal and twingle [Matomo]. If we pass on your personal data, it is
          contractually assured that third parties only process the data on our behalf. For example
          processors are contractually obliged, to either delete or return the data when the
          contract is terminated.
          <br />
          All PayPal transactions are subject to PayPal’s Policy, which is available at
          https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.
          <br />
          All twingle transactions are subject to twingle’s Policy, which is available at
          <a href="https://www.twingle.de/datenschutz/">https://www.twingle.de/datenschutz/</a>. We
          will share your payment and transaction information, including your name, address, company
          name, email address and details of your chosen payment method and information about your
          transaction. For example, our website uses the donation form of twingle GmbH, Prinzenallee
          74, 13357 Berlin. The twingle GmbH provides the technical platform for the donation
          process for this donation form. The data you enter during the donation process (e.g.
          address, bank details, etc.) will be stored by twingle on servers in Germany for the sole
          purpose of processing the donation. We have concluded a contract with twingle for order
          data processing and fully implement the requirements of the EU Data Protection Basic
          Regulation and the German data protection authorities when using the twingle donation
          form. The transmission of your data is based on your consent and the processing for the
          fulfilment of a contract. You have the possibility to revoke your consent to data
          processing at any time. A revocation does not affect the effectiveness of data processing
          operations carried out in the past. In the case of a donation, we collect and use your
          personal data only to the extent necessary to fulfil and process your donation and, if
          applicable, to process your requests. The provision of the data is necessary for the
          handling of the donation process. Failure to provide the data means that your donation
          cannot be received. The processing is necessary for the handling of the donation. Your
          data will not be passed on to third parties without your expressed consent. The only
          exceptions to this are our service partners, who we need to process the donation, or
          service providers we use for processing orders. In addition to the recipients named in the
          respective clauses of this privacy policy, these are, for example, recipients of the
          following categories: Payment service providers, service providers for the dispatch of the
          donation receipt. In all cases we strictly observe the legal requirements. The scope of
          data transfer is limited to a minimum. You have the possibility to revoke your consent to
          data processing at any time. A revocation does not affect the effectiveness of data
          processing operations in the past.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>6.2 Transfer based on legal obligations or for the protection of legitimate interests</h3>
      To the extent we are obliged to do so by law, court order, or by an enforceable official
      order, we will transfer your personal data to bodies entitled to receive information.
      <h3>6.3 Other transfers</h3>
      If you have given us a separate consent form to use and transfer your personal data, your
      personal data may be passed on to the recipients named therein. As part of the provision of
      third-party services on our websites, personal data may be passed on to third parties. In
      addition, no personal data will be transferred on to third parties unless, in individual
      cases, there is a specific legal justification for the transfer, and your interests or
      fundamental rights and freedoms do not prevail.
      <h2>7. Do we transfer your data to third countries?</h2>
      For some types of processing, we may transfer your personal data to countries outside the
      European Union or the European Economic Area, to so-called third countries. In the course of a
      transfer of personal data to a third country, we will regularly provide appropriate
      guarantees, for example, by concluding the Standard Contractual Clauses of the European
      Commission to ensure that the transfer of data takes place with the same level of data
      protection that corresponds to the GDPR.
      <h2>8. How long do we store your personal data?</h2>
      We process and store your personal data only as long as necessary for our processing purposes.
      Upon request, we will regularly delete the data collected and stored for our websites’ usage
      at any time. We will do this ourselves and within a few days, unless we have a particular
      interest in continuing storage for individual cases, e.g., cyberattacks. Regarding your
      contact requests, we only store your data for the time period necessary to answer your
      request. If you have registered for our newsletter, we process your data in this connection
      for the duration of your registration for your newsletter and delete it at any time if you
      unsubscribe from our newsletter. If you have registered at our website, the data is deleted as
      soon as it is no longer required for the purpose of its collection. This is the case for the
      data collected during the registration process if the registration on our website is cancelled
      or modified. The personal data collected during the registration process is usually deleted
      after a period of 30 days in order to enable the registration to be restored after misuse or
      unauthorized use of data by third parties (hacking). As a user you have the possibility to
      cancel the registration at any time by using the delete option in the settings. You can have
      the data stored about you changed at any time. Insofar as a longer retention period is
      required by statutory retention and documentation obligations or to protect our legitimate
      interests, e.g., in the event of possible legal disputes, your personal data will be stored
      and processed even after the above-mentioned period has expired. With complete execution of a
      contract or quasi-contractual relationship, we will, as far as possible, immediately restrict
      your personal data from further processing. A final deletion takes place after the legal
      retention and documentation obligation periods expire, which are between two and ten years and
      result, inter alia, from the Fiscal Code of Germany (Abgabenordnung) or German Commercial Code
      (Handelsgesetzbuch).

      Google. You will find more detailed information in the Google data protection information,

      is only transferred to YouTube when the videos are accessed. Without the “Enhanced Privacy
