      us by e-mail.
      <h2>5. For what purposes and on what legal basis do we process your data?</h2>
      We process your personal data exclusively in accordance with the provisions of the General
      Data Protection Regulation ({"GDPR"}), and the Federal Data Protection Act
      (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz) ({"BDSG"}). In certain situations, we also process your personal
      data to fulfill other legal obligations or based on your explicit consent.
      <h3> 5.1 For the performance of a contract</h3>
      We process our personal data in order to provide the services of our website, in particular
      for the networking of users among each other and the projects provided, in line with Article 6
      (1), first sentence e) GDPR.
      <h3>5.2 To be in compliance with legal obligations</h3>
      To the extent that we are subject to legal obligations, for the compliance of which the
      processing of your personal data is necessary, we process your personal data on the basis of
      these legal obligations in line with Article 6 (1), first sentence e) GDPR.
      <h3>5.3 Based on our legitimate interests</h3>
      We also process your personal data to protect our legitimate interests in line with Article 6
      (1), first sentence f) GDPR, except where your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms,
      which require the protection of your personal data prevail. Subject to a decision to be made
      in individual cases, we usually assume that our legitimate interests prevail within the
      context of the following processing situations, which are not listed exhaustively:
      <ul>
        <li>Improving our offers and services;</li>
        <li>Analysis of the usage of our websites;</li>
        <li>Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of our IT systems;</li>
        <li>Cooperation with public authorities.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>5.4 Based on your consent</h3>
      If you have given us separate consent to process your personal data, we will process your
      personal data within and on the basis of this consent. Consents may, for example, relate to
      the registration, or sending of newsletters, in line with Article 6 (1), first sentence a)
      GDPR. Consent is always freely given. Refusing or revoking your consent will not have any
      negative consequences for you. As part of the registration process, the user’s consent to the
      processing of his data is obtained. User registration is required for the provision of certain
      contents and services on our website. The registration serves the networking of the users
      among themselves and the possibility of posting projects and interacting within this context.
      <h2>6. To whom do we transfer your data?</h2>
      We transfer your personal data to the extent necessary for the formation, execution or
      termination of an agreement or quasi-contractual legal relationship, in principle, within the
      scope of the processing described below. We will share your personal information with the
      following categories of recipients for the purposes set out above:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Third parties at your request</b>: you may choose to share your activities with your
          friends through email, text or on various social media networks;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Service providers and advisors</b>: third party service providers that perform services
          for us, on our behalf, which may include payments processing, providing analytic services
          (e.g. Matomo; Matomo privacy policy is available at https://matomo.org/privacy-policy/)
          providing automatic email notification (e.g. Twilio; Twilio privacy policy is available at
          https://www.twilio.com/legal/tos )
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Transfer to processors</b>
          We use external service providers for the operation of the website and sending E-Mail as
          well as for the handling of donation payments. We use Twilio (Sendgrid) for verifying your
          email address (for login, changing passwordand sending notifications) and for the handling
          of payments within the context of the donations such as Paypal and twingle [Matomo]. If we
          pass on your personal data, it is contractually assured that third parties only process
          the data on our behalf. For example processors are contractually obliged, to either delete
          or return the data when the contract is terminated. All PayPal transactions are subject to
          PayPal’s Policy, which is available at
          https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full. All twingle transactions are
          subject to twingle’s Policy, which is available at https://www.twingle.de/datenschutz/. We
          will share your payment and transaction information, including your name, address, company
          name, email address and details of your chosen payment method and information about your
          transaction. For example, our website uses the donation form of twingle GmbH, Prinzenallee
          74, 13357 Berlin. The twingle GmbH provides the technical platform for the donation
          process for this donation form. The data you enter during the donation process (e.g.
          address, bank details, etc.) will be stored by twingle on servers in Germany for the sole
          purpose of processing the donation. We have concluded a contract with twingle for order
          data processing and fully implement the requirements of the EU Data Protection Basic
          Regulation and the German data protection authorities when using the twingle donation
          form. The transmission of your data is based on your consent and the processing for the
          fulfilment of a contract. You have the possibility to revoke your consent to data
          processing at any time. A revocation does not affect the effectiveness of data processing
          operations carried out in the past. In the case of a donation, we collect and use your
          personal data only to the extent necessary to fulfil and process your donation and, if
          applicable, to process your requests. The provision of the data is necessary for the
          handling of the donation process. Failure to provide the data means that your donation
          cannot be received. The processing is necessary for the handling of the donation. Your
          data will not be passed on to third parties without your expressed consent. The only
          exceptions to this are our service partners, who we need to process the donation, or
          service providers we use for processing orders. In addition to the recipients named in the
          respective clauses of this privacy policy, these are, for example, recipients of the
          following categories: Payment service providers, service providers for the dispatch of the
          donation receipt. In all cases we strictly observe the legal requirements. The scope of
          data transfer is limited to a minimum. You have the possibility to revoke your consent to
          data processing at any time. A revocation does not affect the effectiveness of data
          processing operations in the past.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>6.2 Transfer based on legal obligations or for the protection of legitimate interests</h3>
      To the extent we are obliged to do so by law, court order, or by an enforceable official
      order, we will transfer your personal data to bodies entitled to receive information.
      <h3>6.3 Other transfers</h3>
      If you have given us a separate consent form to use and transfer your personal data, your
      personal data may be passed on to the recipients named therein. As part of the provision of
      third-party services on our websites, personal data may be passed on to third parties. In
      addition, no personal data will be transferred on to third parties unless, in individual
      cases, there is a specific legal justification for the transfer, and your interests or
      fundamental rights and freedoms do not prevail.
      <h2>7. Do we transfer your data to third countries?</h2>
      For some types of processing, we may transfer your personal data to countries outside the
      European Union or the European Economic Area, to so-called third countries. In the course of a
      transfer of personal data to a third country, we will regularly provide appropriate
      guarantees, for example, by concluding the Standard Contractual Clauses of the European
      Commission to ensure that the transfer of data takes place with the same level of data
      protection that corresponds to the GDPR.
      <h2>8. How long do we store your personal data?</h2>
      We process and store your personal data only as long as necessary for our processing purposes.
      Upon request, we will regularly delete the data collected and stored for our websites’ usage
      at any time. We will do this ourselves and within a few days, unless we have a particular
      interest in continuing storage for individual cases, e.g., cyberattacks. Regarding your
      contact requests, we only store your data for the time period necessary to answer your
      request. If you have registered for our newsletter, we process your data in this connection
      for the duration of your registration for your newsletter and delete it at any time if you
      unsubscribe from our newsletter. If you have registered at our website, the data is deleted as
      soon as it is no longer required for the purpose of its collection. This is the case for the
      data collected during the registration process if the registration on our website is cancelled
      or modified. The personal data collected during the registration process is usually deleted
      after a period of 30 days in order to enable the registration to be restored after misuse or
      unauthorized use of data by third parties (hacking). As a user you have the possibility to
      cancel the registration at any time by using the delete option in the settings. You can have
      the data stored about you changed at any time. Insofar as a longer retention period is
      required by statutory retention and documentation obligations or to protect our legitimate
      interests, e.g., in the event of possible legal disputes, your personal data will be stored
      and processed even after the above-mentioned period has expired. With complete execution of a
      contract or quasi-contractual relationship, we will, as far as possible, immediately restrict
      your personal data from further processing. A final deletion takes place after the legal
      retention and documentation obligation periods expire, which are between two and ten years and
      result, inter alia, from the Fiscal Code of Germany (Abgabenordnung) or German Commercial Code
      (Handelsgesetzbuch).

      The cookies used on our website can usually be categorized as follows: mandatory cookies,
      analytical cookies, and function-related cookies. These cookies are essential for the
      functioning of our websites and enable you to move around our websites and to use their
      functions. Without these cookies, certain services that are required for the full functioning

      about how our users use our websites, e.g., which pages are accessed and read most frequently,
      or how users move from one link to the next. All information collected by this type of cookie
      does not relate to a single user but is aggregated and processed with the information of other
      users. Cookies provide us with analytical data on how our websites work and how we can improve
      them. These cookies allow us to save a specific selection you have made and to adapt our
      website in such a way that it offers you extended functions and content. These cookies can be
      used, for example, to save your language selection or country selection.
      <h3>12.4 How long are cookies stored on my device?</h3>
      The retention period depends essentially on whether the cookie is {"persistent"} or{" "}
      {"session-based."} Session-based cookies are deleted after you leave the websites that set the
      cookie. Persistent cookies remain on your device even after you have finished browsing until
      they are deleted or until they have expired.
      <h3>12.5 Third party tracking and online services</h3>
      For the provision of our website we use the services of the third-party providers listed
      below. These third-party tools belong to the categories of the cookies described above and
      help us provide our services on our website or to promote our products and services over the
      internet. We share or allow YouTube, Google Fonts, and [fill in] to collect information about
      your use of our website over time. The information we share is only provided through cookies

      information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the
      site, whether you logged into your account for our services, or otherwise worked with us. The
      following provides additional information about these third parties: We use the open source
      software tool Matomo (former PIWIK) on our website to analyze the surfing behavior of our
      users. If individual pages of our website are called up, the following data are stored:
      <br />
      <div>(1) Two bytes of the IP address of the calling system of the user</div>
      <div>(2) The website called up</div>
      <div>(3) The website from which the user accessed the website (referrer)</div>
      <div>(4) the sub-pages that are called up from the called up website</div>
      <div>(5) The time spent on the website</div>
      <div>(6) The frequency of accessing the website</div>
      <br />
      The software runs exclusively on the servers of our website. A storage of personal data of the
      users only takes place there. The data will not be passed on to third parties. You can prevent
      the use of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser, but we would like to
      point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their
      full extent. You can find more information about the privacy setting of the Matomo software
      under the following link: https://matomo.org/docs/privacy/. The data is deleted as soon as it
      is no longer required for our recording purposes. In our case this is the case after 30 days.
      Cookies are stored on the user’s computer and transmitted by the user to our site. Therefore
      you have full control over the use of cookies. By changing the settings in your internet
      browser, you can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies. Cookies, which have
      already been stored, can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. In the
      donation form of twingle, data is collected and stored using the web analysis service software
      Matomo (www.matomo.org) , a service of the provider InnoCraft Ltd, 150 Willis St, 6011
      Wellingtion, New Zealand based on twingle’s legitimate interest in statistical analysis of
      user behaviour for optimisation purposes. This data can be used to create and evaluate
      pseudonyms, user profiles for the same purpose. Cookies may be used for this purpose. Among
      other things, the cookies enable the recognition of the internet browser. The data collected
      with Matomo Technology (including your pseudonymized IP address) is processed on twingle
      servers. The information generated by the Cookie in the pseudonymous user profile is not used
      to personally identify the visitor of the website an is not merged with personal data about
      the bearer of the pseudonym. If you do not agree with the storage and evaluation of these data
      from your visit, you can object to the storage and use of these data at any time by using the
      banner that that appears when twingle is used. On our internet pages we use external provide
      fonts, Google fonts. Google Fonts is a service of Google Inc. (“Google”). The integration of
      these fonts is done by a server call, usually a Google server in the USA. This transfers to
      the server which of our internet pages you have visited. The IP address of the browser of the
      end device of the visitor is also stored by Google. You will find more detailed information in

      On our internet pages we use the services of the video portal YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave.,
      94066 San Bruno, CA, USA, (“YouTube”) for the integration of videos. In connection with the
      provision of YouTube, we use the “Extended Privacy Mode” which is intended to ensure that data
      is only transferred to YouTube when the videos are accessed. Without the “Enhanced Privacy
      Mode” a connection would be established to YouTube’s server when you visit our websites where
      a video is embedded. A connection to YouTube is required in any case in order to retrieve and
      display a video. In this context YouTube stores at least the IP address, the date and the
      times as well as the website you visited. Furthermore, a connection to advertising network
      “DoubleClick” of Google is established. If you are logged in to YouTube at the time of your
      visit to our website, YouTube can establish a connection to your YouTube account. To prevent
      this, you must either log out of YouTube before visiting our sites or change the settings in
      your YouTube account. For the purpose of ensuring improved usability and the analysis of usage
      behavior, YouTube permanently stores cookies via your internet browser on your end device. If

      cookies by adjusting your internet browser settings. You will find more information on this in

      <h2>13. Technical security measures</h2>
      For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential information that you send
      to us as the website provider, we use SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted
      connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from {"http://"} to{" "}
      {"https://"} and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL or TLS encryption is
      activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
