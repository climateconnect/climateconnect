            The Idea of Climate Connect was born after a local networking event in Chris and Tobis
            Homtown Erlangen, Germany. After the event it was very obivous that not a lot of people
            knew each other or worked together before. The Idea was born to bring this approach to a
            global level. Include as many people as possible to fight climate change together.
