## 5. Event Registration Field Management Flow (introduced in [#1880](https://github.com/climateconnect/climateconnect/issues/1880))
- **Actor**: Organiser / Team Admin
- **Trigger**: Organiser creates or edits an event with registration enabled
- **Actions**:
   1. Organiser navigates to event create/edit form.
   2. Organiser enables event registration (if not already enabled).
   3. Organiser opens the "Registration fields" section (gated behind `REGISTRATION_CUSTOM_FIELDS` toggle).
   4. Organiser adds custom fields (up to 5): checkbox (with rich-text description) or option select (with title and ordered options).
   5. Organiser marks fields as required as needed.
   6. Organiser reorders fields using up/down arrow controls.
   7. Organiser saves the event. Fields are validated on publish (non-draft).
   8. Custom field definitions are stored and returned in the event detail API response.
- **Notes**:
   - Fields are managed as a nested writable array on the existing event create/edit endpoints.
   - Full sync on save: items with `id` are updated, items without `id` are created, absent IDs are deleted (guarded against existing answers).
   - Checkbox description supports rich text (bold + links) stored as sanitized HTML via `bleach`.
   - Option select options are stored as separate `RegistrationFieldOption` rows for addressable FK in future answer storage.
