# LocationIQ Autocomplete: Rate-Limited Queue Design (Celery + Redis Rendezvous)

**Status**: PROPOSED — not yet implemented. Recommended replacement for the custom in-process
worker/queue introduced in `backend/location/queue.py` on `poc-locationIQ_for_autocomplete`
(commit `fcc0e955`, "refactor rate limits, add queue for incoming requests").
**Type**: Backend — replaces a hand-rolled thread/registry queue with a Celery-backed, non-blocking
design.
**Date and time created**: 2026-07-20 14:00
**Related**:
- `review.md` (repo root) — the full code review this design grew out of; see findings #1 and #3
  for the problems being solved here.
- `doc/spec/20260623_1000_locationiq_autocomplete_migration.md` — original POC spec. Its rate-limit
  section (DRF throttle, no Redis) was superseded by the `fcc0e955` refactor and is further
  superseded by this doc.

## Problem Statement

The current `queue.py` design runs its drain-loop worker thread inside `LocationConfig.ready()`,
which executes once per web process. In production (`gunicorn -w 4`), that means 4 independent
worker threads compete on the same Redis queue with no coordination, so:

- the intended 2 req/s cap to LocationIQ isn't actually enforced (can overshoot ~4x);
- cross-process request signaling silently falls back to the full 10s timeout for most requests,
  because the waiter registry (`_request_registry`, `threading.Event`) is per-process memory;
- the single-threaded worker loop is also a throughput cliff — one slow upstream call (up to ~8s)
  stalls every other queued item behind it.

Full analysis of both problems is in `review.md`, findings #1 and #3.

## Options Considered

Four coordination strategies were compared to solve `review.md` finding #1:

| Option | Summary | Why not chosen alone |
|---|---|---|
| A — dedicated worker process | `manage.py run_location_queue_worker` as its own container | New deployable unit; solved better by Celery's existing queue routing (see below) |
| B — Redis leader lock | Elect one web process as drainer via a renewed lock | More custom concurrency code than a dedicated process, for no real benefit |
| D — synchronous Redis rate gate | No queue at all, just a `SET NX PX` gate acquired inline per request | Simple and correct at any process count, but no ordering guarantee — a sustained-arrival pattern can structurally disadvantage one waiter (see `review.md` for the worked example); fixing that means hand-rolling a fair ticket system, which is more custom code than just using Celery |
| **C — Celery task queue** | Reuse existing Celery infra + native `rate_limit`; this doc | **Chosen** — proven infra already used in this exact codebase (`location/tasks.py`'s `fetch_and_create_location_translations` uses `rate_limit="1/s"` for the same class of problem) |

This doc describes a refined version of Option C — merging non-blocking
202+poll delivery, plain-Redis rendezvous, `SET NX` dedup sentinel, dedicated Celery queue with
fixes for gaps neither original version closed (backpressure, TTL/queue-depth consistency, task
failure safety net, broker-down fallback, and the interaction between polling and the per-IP rate
limit).

---

## Design Summary

One Redis key per normalized query acts as both the "is this ready yet" cache and the
deduplication lock. On a cache miss, the view atomically claims the key as a pending sentinel,
enqueues a Celery task (rate-limited to 2/s, running on a dedicated queue/worker so it doesn't
compete with the rest of the app's Celery workload), and returns `202`. The frontend polls the same
endpoint; once the task finishes, it writes the real result into the same key, and subsequent
polls (or fresh identical queries) get a `200` immediately.

No `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` is needed — the rendezvous is a plain Redis key the task writes into
directly, not Celery's own result machinery.

---

## Redis Key Contract

| Key | Shape | TTL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `locationiq:lookup:<normalized_q>` | `{"status": "pending", "job_id": "<uuid>"}` then overwritten with `{"status": "done", "results": [...] \| null, "provider": "locationiq" \| "nominatim" \| null, "job_id": "<uuid>"}` | `SENTINEL_TTL_S` (≈20s) while pending; on completion refreshed to `RESULT_TTL_S` (300s) **for a real result** or `NEGATIVE_TTL_S` (≈8s) **for a failure** (`results is None`) — see Gap #7 | Single rendezvous point: cache, dedup lock, and result delivery in one key |
| `locationiq:pending_jobs` (sorted set) | member = lookup key, score = creation timestamp | n/a (self-pruned by score on every access) | Backpressure accounting — counts distinct in-flight jobs without needing precise increment/decrement bookkeeping |

`normalized_q` is unchanged from the current branch: `_normalize_query(q, countrycodes)` — lowercased, whitespace-stripped, `"{q}|{countrycodes}"`.

## HTTP API Contract

`GET /api/location_autocomplete/?q=...&countrycodes=...`

| Condition | Status | Body |
|---|---|---|
| `q` < 3 or > 200 chars | 200 | `[]` |
| Loose per-IP limit (10/s, all traffic) exceeded | 429 | `{"detail": "Too many requests."}` |
| Lookup key holds a `"done"` result | 200 | `results` array (possibly empty) |
| Lookup key holds a `"pending"` sentinel (someone else's or your own earlier poll) | 202 | `{"status": "pending"}` |
| No key exists, strict per-IP limit (1/s, new jobs only) exceeded | 429 | `{"detail": "Too many requests."}` |
| No key exists, backpressure cap reached | 503 | `{"detail": "Service busy, please retry."}` |
| No key exists, sentinel created, Celery broker unreachable | 200 | direct-fetch fallback result (see Gap #4 below) |
| No key exists, sentinel created, task enqueued successfully | 202 | `{"status": "pending"}` |

Frontend handling of the non-200/202 statuses is specified under "Frontend Changes" — in short,
`429`/`503` are transient "back off and retry / leave the last results as-is" signals, never
surfaced to the user as an error.

The two per-IP limits are separate `django_ratelimit` buckets (`group=` keeps their counters
independent) — see "Closing the Remaining Gaps" #5 for why polling needs to be exempt from the
strict one.

---

## Request Flow

**View (`LocationAutocompleteView.get`)**:

```python
if is_ratelimited(request, key="ip", rate="10/s", group="autocomplete-any", increment=True):
    return Response({"detail": "Too many requests."}, status=429)

q = request.query_params.get("q", "").strip()
if not (3 <= len(q) <= 200):
    return Response([], status=200)

normalized_q = _normalize_query(q, countrycodes)
key = f"locationiq:lookup:{normalized_q}"
redis_conn = get_redis_conn()

raw = redis_conn.get(key)
if raw:
    data = json.loads(raw)
    if data["status"] == "done":
        return Response(data["results"] or [], status=200)
    return Response({"status": "pending"}, status=202)  # cheap poll, no strict rate-limit check

if is_ratelimited(request, key="ip", rate="1/s", group="autocomplete-new", increment=True):
    return Response({"detail": "Too many requests."}, status=429)

redis_conn.zremrangebyscore("locationiq:pending_jobs", "-inf", time.time() - SENTINEL_TTL_S)
if redis_conn.zcard("locationiq:pending_jobs") >= PENDING_CAP:
    return Response({"detail": "Service busy, please retry."}, status=503)

job_id = uuid.uuid4().hex
created = redis_conn.set(
    key, json.dumps({"status": "pending", "job_id": job_id}), nx=True, ex=SENTINEL_TTL_S
)
if created:
    redis_conn.zadd("locationiq:pending_jobs", {key: time.time()})
    try:
        fetch_autocomplete.apply_async(args=[key, job_id, q, countrycodes, accept_language])
    except Exception:
        logger.exception("Celery broker unavailable, falling back to direct fetch")
        results, provider = _fetch_results(q, countrycodes, accept_language)
        _store_result(redis_conn, key, job_id, results, provider)  # shared writer, see below
        redis_conn.zrem("locationiq:pending_jobs", key)            # don't leak the backpressure slot
        if results is not None:
            _increment_counters(provider)
        return Response(results or [], status=200)

return Response({"status": "pending"}, status=202)
```

Both the task and this broker-down branch write the terminal state through one shared helper, so the
success-vs-failure TTL rule (Gap #7) lives in exactly one place:

```python
def _store_result(redis_conn, key, job_id, results, provider):
    ttl = RESULT_TTL_S if results is not None else NEGATIVE_TTL_S
    redis_conn.setex(key, ttl, json.dumps(
        {"status": "done", "results": results, "provider": provider, "job_id": job_id}
    ))
```

**Task (`location/tasks.py`)**:

```python
@shared_task(rate_limit="2/s")
def fetch_autocomplete(key, job_id, q, countrycodes, accept_language):
    redis_conn = get_redis_conn()
    try:
        results, provider = _fetch_results(q, countrycodes, accept_language)
    except Exception:
        logger.exception("fetch_autocomplete failed unexpectedly for %r", q)
        results, provider = None, None

    current = redis_conn.get(key)
    if current and json.loads(current).get("job_id") != job_id:
        return  # superseded by a newer generation; don't clobber it

    _store_result(redis_conn, key, job_id, results, provider)  # short TTL on failure (Gap #7)
    redis_conn.zrem("locationiq:pending_jobs", key)
    if results is not None:
        _increment_counters(provider)
```

`_store_result` (shown above under the view) applies `RESULT_TTL_S` to a real result but only
`NEGATIVE_TTL_S` to a failure (`results is None`), so a transient double-provider outage — or a
crashed task, which lands here with `results = None` too — self-corrects within seconds instead of
being cached as an empty answer for the full 5 minutes (Gap #7).

No retries (`bind=True, max_retries=...`) — unlike `fetch_and_create_location_translations`, this
task's own `_fetch_results` already exhausts both providers internally; a Celery-level retry would
just repeat that same double-provider attempt at extra quota cost for no real benefit on a
user-facing, time-sensitive request.

---

## Backend Changes

- `location/tasks.py`: add `fetch_autocomplete` as above.
- `climateconnect_main/settings.py`:
  - `CELERY_TASK_ROUTES = {"location.tasks.fetch_autocomplete": {"queue": "lookup"}}`
  - `LOCATIONIQ_PENDING_CAP = 16`
  - `LOCATIONIQ_SENTINEL_TTL_S = 20`
  - `LOCATIONIQ_RESULT_TTL_S = 300` — positive cache lifetime (unchanged from the current branch's
    `RESULT_TTL_S`).
  - `LOCATIONIQ_NEGATIVE_TTL_S = 8` — short cache lifetime for a failed lookup, so a transient
    outage isn't cached as an empty result (Gap #7).
  - `LOCATIONIQ_DAILY_BUDGET` (see Gap #6) — configurable, defaults to whatever LocationIQ's actual
    plan allows with headroom.
  - Celery broker fail-fast: set a short broker connection timeout (e.g.
    `broker_transport_options={"socket_connect_timeout": 2, "socket_timeout": 2}` /
    `broker_connection_retry_on_startup=False`) so the broker-down branch's `apply_async()` raises
    within ~2s instead of blocking the request while Celery retries the connection. Without this the
    "broker unreachable → direct fetch" fallback (Gap #4) can hang rather than fail fast.
- `docker-compose.yml`: new `celery-lookup` service, same image as the existing `celery` service,
  different command:
  ```yaml
  celery-lookup:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: docker/backend.Dockerfile
    command: pdm run celery -A climateconnect_main worker -Q lookup -c 4 -l INFO
    env_file:
      - ./backend/.backend_env
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
      - backend
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
      - backend-venv:/app/.venv
  ```
  `-c 4`, not `-c 1` — concurrency and `rate_limit` do different jobs (see Gap discussion in
  `review.md` finding #1/#3); `-c 1` alone would reintroduce the single-slow-task-blocks-everyone
  throughput cliff this design is meant to fix. The existing `celery` service is unaffected since it
  only consumes its default queue, not `lookup`.

  **This is still exactly one worker process** — one `celery-lookup:` service definition, no
  `replicas:`/`scale:`. `-c 4` is Celery's *internal* concurrency pool within that single process
  (comparable to `gunicorn --threads 4` on one worker), not multiple independent processes the way
  `gunicorn -w 4` is on the `backend` service — that distinction is the entire point of this
  redesign, so it's worth being explicit: the single worker process owns the one connection to the
  broker and the one rate-limiter state for `fetch_autocomplete`, and decides centrally — before
  ever handing a task to one of the 4 execution slots — whether a new call may start yet.
  Regardless of `-c`, the aggregate *start* rate stays capped at exactly `LOCATIONIQ_MAX_RATE`;
  concurrency only controls how many already-approved calls can be in flight at once. Scaling this
  service's replica count (e.g. `docker compose up --scale celery-lookup=N`) would reproduce the
  original multi-process bug — N independent workers each enforcing their own 2/s cap — so don't.
- `queue.py`: the worker-thread/registry machinery (`start_worker`, `_queue_worker`,
  `_request_registry`, `RequestState`) is deleted entirely; `_fetch_results`, `_try_locationiq`,
  `_try_nominatim`, `_normalize_query`, `get_redis_conn` are kept (moved into `location/tasks.py`
  or left in `queue.py` as shared helpers, whichever keeps imports cleanest).
- `location/apps.py`: the `start_worker()` call in `ready()` and the `SKIP_WORKER_COMMANDS`
  machinery built to support it are removed — no in-process worker to start anymore.

## Frontend Changes

`LocationSearchBar.tsx`:

- Keep the 3-char minimum guard and add a real debounce (~300-500ms) before the *first* request for
  a new value (closes `review.md` finding #2).
- On `202`, poll the same URL until the result is ready, using a **fast-first, then backing-off**
  schedule rather than a flat ≥1s interval — e.g. first re-poll at ~250ms, then ~500ms, then ~1s,
  capped at a max total wait (~8-10s) before giving up and clearing the loading state. Rationale:
  in the common uncontended case the result is ready in ~150ms, so a flat 1s first poll would make
  every search feel ~1s slower than it needs to; a short first poll keeps the happy path snappy
  while the backoff keeps a genuinely queued request from polling aggressively. Pending-polls don't
  consume the strict per-IP budget (see Gap #5), and even the fastest schedule here stays well
  under the loose 10/s limit.
- On `429` (either rate-limit bucket) or `503` (backpressure), treat it as transient: keep the
  previously shown options, don't surface an error to the user, and either stop for this keystroke
  or retry once after a short backoff (~1s). These are "busy, try again" signals, not failures.
- Extend the existing `active`-flag cleanup pattern to cancel an in-flight *poll loop* (not just a
  single request) when `searchValue` changes or the component unmounts.
- Optional, non-load-bearing: a client-side cap on real enqueues per rolling window (the
  colleague's "3-5 enqueues / 2-3s" idea) as a defense-in-depth UX safeguard. This is **not** a
  security control — any client bypassing the frontend (curl, script, botnet) is unaffected by it;
  the real protections are the server-side rate limits and backpressure cap above.

---

## Closing the Remaining Gaps

1. **Sentinel TTL vs. worst-case queue wait.** With `PENDING_CAP=16` and `rate_limit=2/s`, the
   last-admitted job waits up to ~8s just to start, plus up to ~8s worst-case fetch time
   (`LOCATIONIQ_TIMEOUT=3s` + `NOMINATIM_TIMEOUT=5s`) — up to ~16s total. `SENTINEL_TTL_S=20`
   comfortably covers that. **Keep these three constants (`PENDING_CAP`, the task's `rate_limit`,
   `SENTINEL_TTL_S`) consistent with this formula whenever any one of them is tuned** —
   `sentinel_ttl ≳ (pending_cap / rate_limit) + max_fetch_time + margin`. If the sentinel expires
   before a queued job completes, a second sentinel can be created for the same query (temporarily
   breaking dedup) and a stale write can race a fresher one — mitigated by the `job_id` check
   (Gap #3), but the formula should hold in the first place rather than relying on that as the only
   defense.
2. **Task crashes without writing a terminal state.** The top-level `try/except` in
   `fetch_autocomplete` guarantees *some* write to the lookup key even on a totally unexpected
   exception — pollers get a fast `{"status": "done", "results": null}` instead of waiting out the
   full sentinel TTL.
3. **Stale writes across sentinel generations.** The `job_id` compare-before-write in the task
   means a task from a superseded generation can't clobber a newer one's data — cheap, no locking.
4. **Broker unreachable at enqueue time.** `apply_async()` is wrapped in `try/except`; on failure,
   the view does `_fetch_results()` synchronously inline for that one request and writes the result
   directly, mirroring the resilience the current branch's `enqueue_request` already has for
   "Redis unavailable."
5. **Polling and the per-IP rate limit.** The strict 1 req/s limit only applies on the branch that
   creates a *new* sentinel (a real, expensive enqueue) — checking on an existing pending job is a
   cheap Redis `GET` and doesn't consume that budget, which also means the frontend's own polling
   can never rate-limit itself. A separate, looser blanket limit (10 req/s, all paths) still guards
   against a buggy/runaway polling client hammering Redis.
6. **Daily/monthly LocationIQ quota exhaustion.** The check lives inside `_try_locationiq` (the one
   place that actually calls LocationIQ), right after the existing empty-API-key guard: read today's
   `NominatimPeriodStats` row for `provider=locationiq` and, once `total_requests` crosses
   `LOCATIONIQ_DAILY_BUDGET`, return `(None, None)` immediately so `_fetch_results` falls through to
   Nominatim for the rest of the day. Putting it here (not in the view or task body) means every
   path that could hit LocationIQ — the queued task *and* the broker-down direct-fetch fallback — is
   covered by the same guard. IP-agnostic, so it also backstops the IPv6-address-rotation bypass
   noted in `review.md`'s security discussion, where per-IP limits alone don't protect the shared
   budget from a small number of technically compliant clients. (Reading the row per call is cheap;
   if it ever shows up in profiling, cache the "over budget" boolean in Redis with a short TTL.)
7. **Failure/crash cached as an empty result ("negative caching").** A terminal write happens even
   when both providers fail (`results is None`) or the task crashes — otherwise pollers would hang
   until `SENTINEL_TTL_S`. But writing that `results: null` state under the full `RESULT_TTL_S`
   (300s) would make the view serve an immediate empty `200` for that query for 5 minutes, long
   after the providers recover. `_store_result` therefore uses `NEGATIVE_TTL_S` (~8s) whenever
   `results is None`, and only a real result gets the full 300s. This keeps the crash-safety net
   (Gap #2) and the both-providers-down case from poisoning the cache: a failed query is retried a
   few seconds later rather than stuck empty. Note this is distinct from a *legitimately empty*
   result — once the empty-list-is-success fix lands (see Risks table), a real "no matches" response
   is `results: []` (not `None`), so it correctly gets the full 300s positive cache; only genuine
   errors get the short TTL.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| `celery-lookup` scaled to >1 replica in the future silently multiplies the effective rate (same class of issue as the original multi-process bug, just relocated) | One-line comment on the service definition and near the task decorator noting this is a hard single-replica assumption; revisit with a distributed rate limiter if this service is ever scaled |
| Empty-but-valid provider response currently treated as failure, forcing unnecessary fallback calls (`review.md` low/nits) | Fix alongside this work — `isinstance(data, list)` instead of `isinstance(data, list) and data` in `_try_locationiq`/`_try_nominatim` |
| A backend/proxy layer in front of Django may have its own idle/read timeout | Largely defused by this design vs. a blocking design — no single request is held open for more than a Redis round-trip, so proxy timeouts are much less of a concern here than they were for the blocking `.get()` alternative considered earlier |
| Reused `_fetch_results`/provider logic must stay behind a stable import path once moved out of `queue.py` | Land the move and the queue rewrite in the same change, update all call sites (`location_views.py`, tests) together |

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `queue.py`'s worker-thread/registry machinery is removed; no code path starts a background
      thread from `AppConfig.ready()`.
- [ ] `fetch_autocomplete` runs on a dedicated `lookup` queue/worker, concurrency > 1, `rate_limit="2/s"`.
- [ ] A cache hit (existing `"done"` key) returns `200` with no Celery dispatch.
- [ ] A cache miss creates exactly one sentinel/task per distinct query, even under concurrent
      identical requests (dedup via `SET NX`).
- [ ] Polling a pending job never trips the strict per-IP limit; a genuinely new query does.
- [ ] Exceeding `LOCATIONIQ_PENDING_CAP` distinct in-flight queries returns `503`, not an unbounded
      queue.
- [ ] A task that raises unexpectedly still resolves its lookup key to a terminal `"done"` state.
- [ ] A failed lookup (both providers down, or a crashed task) is cached only for `NEGATIVE_TTL_S`,
      not `RESULT_TTL_S` — a retry a few seconds later actually re-attempts instead of getting a
      stuck empty result.
- [ ] The broker-down direct-fetch fallback removes its `pending_jobs` entry (no leaked backpressure
      slot) and writes its terminal state through the same `_store_result` TTL rule as the task.
- [ ] Broker unavailability at enqueue time still returns a real result (direct-fetch fallback)
      within ~2s, not an error and not a hang (broker connection timeout configured).
- [ ] Today's `NominatimPeriodStats` `provider=locationiq` total is checked inside `_try_locationiq`
      (covering both the queued task and the direct-fetch fallback) once `LOCATIONIQ_DAILY_BUDGET`
      is configured.
- [ ] Frontend: 3-char guard + debounce on first request; polls on `202` with a fast-first/backoff
      schedule; treats `429`/`503` as transient (no user-facing error); cancels its poll loop on
      unmount/query change; gives up gracefully after its own max-wait.

## Open Questions / Follow-ups

- What should `LOCATIONIQ_DAILY_BUDGET` actually be set to? Depends on the specific LocationIQ plan
  — needs a real number from whoever manages that account.
- Should `pending_jobs` depth, task latency, and the 202→give-up rate be surfaced as metrics/alerts?
  Not required for a first cut given current traffic (~100 req/day), but worth adding before this
  is relied on under materially higher load.
- Confirm nothing in front of Django (load balancer/reverse proxy) has an idle timeout that would
  matter here — likely a non-issue given no single request is held open, but unverified since no
  such config exists in this repo.

## Log

- 2026-07-20 14:00 — Doc created, synthesizing the queue-design discussion from `review.md`'s
  finding #1/#3 threads (blocking vs. non-blocking delivery, Celery vs. hand-rolled worker,
  colleague's rendezvous-and-poll proposal, and the backpressure/TTL/fairness gaps identified while
  fusing the two).
- 2026-07-20 — Review pass fixes folded in: added Gap #7 (negative-caching bug — failures/crashes
  were cached as empty results for the full 5-minute `RESULT_TTL_S`; now use a short `NEGATIVE_TTL_S`
  via a shared `_store_result` writer). Smaller gaps: broker-down fallback now `zrem`s its
  `pending_jobs` slot; fast-first/backoff frontend poll schedule to avoid a ~1s happy-path latency
  regression; explicit frontend `429`/`503` handling; daily-budget check pinned to `_try_locationiq`
  so both task and fallback paths are covered; broker connection-timeout note so the fallback fails
  fast instead of hanging.
