      "shortdescription": "We are convincing the organization responsible for the university canteens in our region to add a label with the CO2-footprint to each meal in the canteens. This way we are going to enable students to make more informed and climate-friendly food choices",
      "description": "We approached the Studentenwerk, which is responsible for 2 Canteens in Erlangen, 8 Canteens in Nürnberg as well as the Canteens in Eichstätt, Ingolstadt, Ansbach and Triersdorf. A combined number of 14,000 students eats in these canteens each day We are going to propose the idea of adding CO2-labels to their dishes to encourage students to eat more climate-friendly. Update 1: They liked the idea and gave us some samples from their database which we would then use to calculate the CO2-footprints of the dishes ourselves. However, we realised that this might be a too big project for us to conduct as a student group. Update 2: We did a test run by displaying very rough CO2-estiamtes of the dishes on a banner in front of the entrance of the mensa. People were quite interested. However, because we were unable to calculate precise estimates for the dishes we let the project slide for a while. Update 3:To our surprise the Studentenwerk took this into their own hands and started negotiations with the company 'eaternity'. This company does professional CO2-calculations for food. We are very excited about this development and were allowed to accompany the process of implementing CO2-footprints to the dishes if the company and the Studentenwerk end up making a deal.",

The Studentenwerk decided to take the issue into their own hands and is now in negotiations with a private company that does CO2-calculations for meals. They are willing to invest a significant sum of money into this project. We will be able to accompany the process and meet them every few months to control the process. The deal is not yet done but if it happens the result will be much more professional and it will be easier to copy the concept into other cities since we already know who to contact to do the CO2-calculations and how much it would cost.",
