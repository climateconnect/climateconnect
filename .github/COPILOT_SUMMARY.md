## How to Use

### For Developers

1. **IDE Setup**:
   - Open the project in VS Code
   - Install recommended extensions when prompted
   - Copilot will automatically use the instructions

2. **Writing Code**:
   - Start typing or add descriptive comments
   - Copilot will suggest context-aware code
   - Use snippets: Type `cc` + Tab to see available snippets
   - Reference GLOSSARY.md for domain terminology

3. **Code Generation Tips**:
   - Write clear, descriptive comments before code blocks
   - Reference existing patterns in comments (e.g., "Similar to UserProfileSerializer")
   - Be specific about requirements (e.g., "Create a DRF viewset with pagination and filtering")

### For Team Leads

1. **Onboarding New Developers**:
   - Point them to `.github/COPILOT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - Have them review `GLOSSARY.md` for domain terms
   - Ensure they install recommended VS Code extensions

2. **Code Review**:
   - Check that Copilot-generated code follows the patterns in `copilot-instructions.md`
   - Verify security-sensitive code manually
   - Ensure proper error handling and testing

3. **Maintenance**:
   - Update `copilot-instructions.md` when patterns change
   - Add new snippets for frequently written code
   - Review and update GLOSSARY.md with new features

## Expected Benefits

### Productivity Improvements

- ✅ Reduced context switching (less time looking up docs)
- ✅ Better test coverage (easy test generation)

### Code Quality Improvements
- ✅ Consistent error handling patterns
- ✅ Proper database optimization (select_related, etc.)
- ✅ Better accessibility in frontend components
- ✅ Security best practices built-in

### Developer Experience
- ✅ Easier onboarding for new developers
- ✅ Less time spent on repetitive tasks
- ✅ More time for complex problem-solving
- ✅ Built-in documentation and examples

## Monitoring Effectiveness
